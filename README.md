# Pytorch-Siamese

This project goal is to develop a CNN able to track a given object across a sequence of frames.

The algorithm runs in a NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and detects a specific person in real time.

The implementation is based in https://github.com/huanglianghua/siamfc-pytorch, which is an implementation of https://github.com/bertinetto/siamese-fc in PyTorch.

See the original project in https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~luca/siamese-fc.html.
